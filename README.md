# odin-recipes
This is a project that I am completing in order to demonstrate the skills I have aquired whilst undertaking The Odin Project.

Upon completing this prject I will have demonstrated my knowledge in basic HTMl ie. different tags, adding hyperlinks, adding images and also basic navigation of Github which i have already used in order to create this repo and copy it to my machine.

It won't look pretty, but that's not the point right now. 

First I get comfortable riding, then I take off the training wheels.

Godspeed, Spider-man.
